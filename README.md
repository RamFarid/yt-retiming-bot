You can use command _/retiming_ then put your link then 'to' then the time you want like this:
<b>/retiming https://youtu.be/xxxxxxxxxxx to 1m2s</b>

> In the previous example I will send you a new link that directive you to the first minute and the 2th second ðŸ˜Ž

**Consider the following entities**:

- hour = h
- minute = m
- second = s

so if you want at 3 minutes and 6 seconds, It be like this `3m6s`
